# mobile-app-use-react-native

This code is a simple example of a mobile app display containing a single text "Hello, World!" which is laid out and styled using a StyleSheet in React Native.

In that code, we create an App class that inherits from Component and implements the render() method. Inside the render() method, we create a View which has a container style and contains a single Text with a text style.

At the bottom of the code, we create a styles object using StyleSheet.create(). The styles object consists of two properties, namely container and text, which are set according to the display needs of the mobile app.

You can further develop the code to create more complex mobile app views. Be sure to consult the React Native documentation to understand more about the concepts and components included in it.
